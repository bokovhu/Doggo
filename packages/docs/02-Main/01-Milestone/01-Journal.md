# Milestone 1

:::info
This document records our progress of the first planned milestone of the Doggo project. It acts as a journal of our work, and shows the current state of the project on `2024.01.17`.

## Planning

:::warning
Milestones for Doggo were not planned ahead of time, so this document contains this section for all milestones.
:::

* A mobile-focused web-based game
* Blockchain records NFTs, which are playable cards in the game
* Players build a deck by:
    * _Trading_ with other players,
    * _Minting_ for the native token,
    * Winning a _match_ against another player
* Each match is a _simulated battle_ between a selected _army_ of the players:
    * When _challenging a player_, you must _select yout bet_, and select _what you want from the opponent_ if you win. Your opponent then has the option to _accept or decline_ the challenge; they might optionally send a _new challenge_ with different terms.
    * The _first phase_ of the game is the _army assembly stage_; players have _60 seconds_ to select the _10 cards_ from the deck they want to play, and set up the AI of their army.
    * The _second phase_ of the game is the _battle stage_; a simulated battle begins, and each card summons a _squad of units_ to fight for the player. Each individual unit is _controlled by machine-learning based AI_, and the units fight until last blood, or until the _time limit_ of _5 minutes_ is reached (at which point the player with the most units wins).
* Players must _train the AI_ on their _own devices_.

_ðŸª§ Milestone 1_

* Architecture assembled
* PWA manifest
* Basic UI with the following options:
    * _Challenge player_
    * _(N) challenges_ (only appears if there are challenges)
    * _Deck_
    * _Mint_
    * _Trade_
    * _AI Training_

    * `@doggo/airplane` - The airplane package, which contains the airplane game object
    * `@doggo/asteroid` - The asteroid package, which contains the asteroid game object
    * `@doggo/arena` - The arena package, which contains the arena game object
    * `@doggo/battle` - Battle simulation game logic (THREE.js) **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

_ðŸª§ Milestone 2_

* Smart Contract
    * Card NFT, deck building
    * Minting

## Packages

:::info
In this section we give detailed information about the _design_ of all packages in the project.
:::

### `@doggo/model`

It contains the interfaces and types for the domain of the game, namely:

* `Army`
* `Squad`
* `Card`
* `Deck`
* `PlayerProfile`
* `PlayerInBattle`
* `AirplaneKind`
* `Challenge`

### `@doggo/web`

It contains the web application package, which is the game itself. It is a PWA, and it is built with React.

### `@doggo/app`

It contains the `<App />` component of the application, which is the _first page_ of the application (main menu).

### `@doggo/app-training`

It contains the `<Training />` page of the application, which is the _page on which the player can train their AI model using evolution._

### `@doggo/training`

It contains the `TrainingGame` class, which is the _main class for a web-based game_. The game logic is responsible for running the _training loop_ of the AI, and emitting new models, and training progress information during the training towards the owner code.

### `@doggo/ai`
